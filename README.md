# Macro Overwhelming.
This is a somewhat unreliable macro for Balanced Craftwars Overhaul with a biome hopping feature, created due to an idea in the BCWO wiki, at [https://bcwo-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:Biome_farming](https://bcwo-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Guide:Biome_farming).
This currently only works at 1440p at 100% scaling in fullscreen if you're using the biome hopping or event functions, and the program will definitely not check for you, but if you've got a 2560 * 1440 screen, then go ahead and use it. Also, devs, pls no ban.

## Installation
No installation instructions yet, however, this script is intended for [AutoHotkey v2.0.9](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/), and since I won't include AutoHotkey with this program or anything, despite it also being GPL V2, (if you bundle it in a PR, downloaded from AutoHotkey's website, I'll accept it), you'll have to go and install that yourself, then, it should be as simple as just running the file.

## Usage
For now there is no GUI, so you'll have to manually edit a config file, and simply run the macro through AHK after that.

## Contribution
The code of the original script that I wrote is not good, only works on 2560*1440 screens, with Microsoft Edge, has no GUI, is filled with code repetition, and so on, so any contributions are welcome.
