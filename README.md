This currently only works on my machine in fullscreen if you're using the biome hopping or event functions, but if you've got a 2560 * 1440 screen, then go ahead and use it. Also, devs, pls no ban.

## Contribution
The code of the original script that I wrote is not good, only works on 2560*1440 screens, with Microsoft Edge, has no GUI, is filled with code repetition, and so on, so any contributions are welcome.
