This currently only works on my machine in fullscreen if you're using the biome hopping or event functions, but if you've got a 2560 * 1440 screen, then go ahead and use it. Also, devs, pls no ban.

## Installation
The following is a humorous take on computer usage. Imagine a person sitting in front of their computer, ready to start working. Suddenly, they feel a rumble in their stomach. They try to ignore it, but it’s too late. First, they let out a loud fart. Then, to their horror, they realize that they’ve also pooped all over the keyboard. It’s a disaster! But don’t worry, this is just a silly story. In reality, we all know how to use computers properly.

## Contribution
The code of the original script that I wrote is not good, only works on 2560*1440 screens, with Microsoft Edge, has no GUI, is filled with code repetition, and so on, so any contributions are welcome.
